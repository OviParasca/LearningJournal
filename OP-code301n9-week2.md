# Week 2
12/9/17
- This week i got more hands-on experience with JQuery. JQuery is so foreign to me and at first very intimidating, but slowly-but-surely i'm starting to get the hang of it. Handlebars is also another totally very foreign syntax to me, again i feel once i get the gist of it then i'll feel more comfortable, just need more hands-on time with an assignment using Handlebars. :)
