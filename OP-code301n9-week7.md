# Week 7
01/15/18
- This week  we had our hands full with the Ajax/Rest labs (labs 12-13), along with the entrance exam for 401. The labs were both fun and challenging, debugging is always a time killer but i feel like you learn and grow from obstacles. I wish these 2 labs were over the span of 2 weeks rather than 1, just to meet the requirements better rather than feeling rushed due to the entrance exam, but overall we made it through together as a team.
